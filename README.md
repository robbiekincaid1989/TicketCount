# TicketCount
A simple Java GUI application in Java with an option to export ticket counts to a CSV file.

# Why?
This was made as a way to keep track of the two ticket types we make in our store. It stores integers for triage and repair tickets and allows the user to display the totals for each. It also allows the user to export the day's count to a simple CSV file as a method of "reporting."

This application was my first foray into Java that wasn't a school assignment, and was very useful for my day job.

I'm considering updating it with a SQLite database for data persistance.
